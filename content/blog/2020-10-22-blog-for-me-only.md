So your blog site is now ready, and succesfully deployed to the netlify, now for writing a new blog and maintaining a site you just want to go ali26-blog.netlify.app/admin here write a blog and post it

it changes directly to the live blog and also automatically initialize commit with a heading in your github



and voila thats it

but if you want to change some designing or implement some new features, so what you do??

here I will explain it,

go get your cup of a coffee first

type bash in start menu 

go to your directry cd ali-blog

initialize git with the command  "git init" 

then pull in to your local machine with "git pull"

afterwards just push your changes with my favourite command "git push"

Voila

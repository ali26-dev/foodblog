> ### *Git is a distributed version control system*
>
> ### *Git is for tracking the changes in your source code during one particular development*
>
> ### *It is designed to handles every project with speed and efficiency*
>
> ### *Git also helps you synchronise the code between multiple people*

* ### There are six key terminologies:

1. ### Repository
2. ### Branch
3. ### Commit
4. ### Clone
5. ### Fetch
6. ### Fork

## Repository**:**

 A repository is like a folder for your project. It contains the collection of the file as well as the history of the changes made to those files.

## Branch**:**

It is contained within the repository but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. You can merge it back into the master branch when you are ready to publish your changes.

## Commit**:**

Commits are easily one of the most frequented activities by a developer using GitHub. Simply put, a commit or revision is like 'saving' an updated file to its original folder.

## Clone**:**

It is used to make a copy of the target repository or clone it, but you can't push changes to original repo if you are not project owner.

## Fetch**:**

Fetching refers to getting the latest changes from a remote repository without merging them in. Once these changes are fetched you can now compare them to your local branches

## Fork**:**

A fork is a rough copy of another user's repo. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project.

## Conclusion**:**

In more simpler words:

Repository: The location where your code history is stored. Branch: "Folder" within the repository containing commits Commits: Different stages of your code inside a branch.

Happy Learning ❤️
